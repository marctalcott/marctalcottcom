[{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started blogging in 2013 - 2017 on \u0026lsquo;marcustalcott.com\u0026rsquo;. You can find my old\narticles on Wayback Machine. After 2017 I changed that several times trying to incorporate my\nphotography, and moving the site from service to service. I lost most of the old articles, but that\nis fine with me. Tech articles from 2013 aren\u0026rsquo;t very relevant anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have posted more recent technical posts on \u003ca href=\"https://elixm.com/\"\u003eElixm.com\u003c/a\u003e. These are generally\nrelated to Event Sourcing, Event Modeling, CQRS, Hexagonal Achitecture, and anything else\nrelated to developing Event Sourced Applications. I continue to work in Event Sourcing as much\nas possible and I believe that it is an excellent way to design projects of any size thanks to\nthe consistent complexity of the method. Sure it is more complex to start that some other methods, but\nthe complexity is baked in and well known. Building more traditional layered architectures tend to start\nsimple and grow in complexity overtime. The complexity will grow and grow, until the team wants to start over.  I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it over and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"why-this-why-now\"\u003eWhy this? Why now?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why am I starting a new blog on a new platform?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want a new home for me to capture my writing and thoughts. My life has changed a lot in the last few years. I\u0026rsquo;m still deeply\ninvolved in technology, but I\u0026rsquo;m aslo exploring other interests. This will be my hub site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elixm.com/\"\u003eElixm.com\u003c/a\u003e will probably be where I continueto put tech articles.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://talcottfarm.com\"\u003eTalcott Farm\u003c/a\u003e - I\u0026rsquo;m very interested in regenerative farming since that became a hobby during Covid that has continued to spark joy for me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also a photographer, and want to tie into that here at times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also a learner, and as I learn new things, my interests seem to wander in new directions. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to follow that path.\nFeel free to join me and see where this goes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:60824/posts/my-first-post/","title":"My First Post"}]
