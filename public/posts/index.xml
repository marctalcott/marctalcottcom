      <description>Introduction I started blogging in 2013 - 2017 on &amp;lsquo;marcustalcott.com&amp;rsquo;. You can find my old articles on Wayback Machine. After 2017 I changed that several times trying to incorporate my photography, and moving the site from service to service. I lost most of the old articles, but that is fine with me. Tech articles from 2013 aren&amp;rsquo;t very relevant anymore.&#xA;I have posted more recent technical posts on Elixm.com. These are generally related to Event Sourcing, Event Modeling, CQRS, Hexagonal Achitecture, and anything else related to developing Event Sourced Applications.</description>
