## Introduction

I started blogging in 2013 - 2017 on 'marcustalcott.com'. You can find my old 
articles on Wayback Machine. After 2017 I changed that several times trying to incorporate my 
photography, and moving the site from service to service. I lost most of the old articles, but that 
is fine with me. Tech articles from 2013 aren't very relevant anymore.

I have posted more recent technical posts on [Elixm.com](https://elixm.com/). These are generally 
related to Event Sourcing, Event Modeling, CQRS, Hexagonal Achitecture, and anything else
related to developing Event Sourced Applications. I continue to work in Event Sourcing as much
as possible and I believe that it is an excellent way to design projects of any size thanks to 
the consistent complexity of the method. Sure it is more complex to start that some other methods, but
the complexity is baked in and well known. Building more traditional layered architectures tend to start 
simple and grow in complexity overtime. The complexity will grow and grow, until the team wants to start over.  I've seen it over and over.

## Why this? Why now?

So why am I starting a new blog on a new platform? 

I want a new home for me to capture my writing and thoughts. My life has changed a lot in the last few years. I'm still deeply
involved in technology, but I'm aslo exploring other interests. This will be my hub site. 
- [Elixm.com](https://elixm.com/) will probably be where I continueto put tech articles.
- [Talcott Farm](https://talcottfarm.com) - I'm very interested in regenerative farming since that became a hobby during Covid that has continued to spark joy for me.
- I'm also a photographer, and want to tie into that here at times.
- I'm also a learner, and as I learn new things, my interests seem to wander in new directions. I'm happy to follow that path.
Feel free to join me and see where this goes.
